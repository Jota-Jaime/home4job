# Home4Job

This app borns with one main goal: give to the travelers the opportunity of save some money on their travels. How it works? Easy. Some people need help with some home task like keep the garden, clean the house, etc. What could happen if this people can also offer a room to someone who can do this kind of jobs??

With Home4Job, we bring the possibility of contact to this two kind of persons.

We made Home4Job with Express, MongoDB, Hbs, JavaScript, NodeJS, PassPort, GoogleMaps API and a little piece of love ;).

Thanks to our TAs and partners to help us to make it possible.
